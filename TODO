Fixs:
    * Make it work to download a file with only one click, I don't know why
      with text files I need to click several times to open it... Maybe we
      should show a "save as" dialog to save the file instead of trying to
      open with xdg-open.

    * Ignore launched threads when changing room...
    * Sort rooms by last message or fav?

    * Load more should work with search, currently loads the room messages,
      but not continues with the search

Functionality:

    * Show event messages in message list
    * Register
    * Room creation
    * Change user display name
    * Change user avatar
    * Store last read message to show differently

Events to manage:
    * Join / leave from current user
    * Invite event

Blurhash:
  * Why when downloading message history does the message not get the blurhash key?
  * Calculate blurhash with only a partial image, and then scale up to thumbnail size
  * Make Image draw blurhash with the size of the thumbnail
  * An invalid blurhash will crash Fractal, could easily be abused


  * Add video support
  * Add support for inline images (<img>)

  * Choose better x/y components for blurhash
  * Clean up code
