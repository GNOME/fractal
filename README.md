The origin of Fractal
---------------------

This project is based on ruma-gtk https://github.com/jplatte/ruma-gtk

Instead of using RUMA Client, Fractal calls directly to the matrix.org
REST API.

The first version of this project was called guillotine, based on french revolution,
in relation with the Riot client name, but it's a negative name so we decide
to change for a math one.

The name Fractal was proposed by Regina Bíró.
